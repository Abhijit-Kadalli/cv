Our team consisted of a professor and a brilliant PhD student whose expertise was in fabricating neuromorphic hardware specialized chips designed to mimic the brain's structure. My role was to handle model training and machine learning."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Our project was focused on classifying ECG signals using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). The reason we were using an SNN wasn't just because it was a cool piece of tech. It was about power. Traditional AI models are incredibly power-hungry. An SNN, inspired by the human brain which runs on just a few watts, is wildly efficient. It works in \"spikes,\" turning complex multiplications into simple additions and making it ideal for real world, temporal data. This efficiency is key to building AI that can run for days on a tiny battery."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"And model training is my shiz. I built the SNN, trained it to distinguish between normal and abnormal signals, and even quantized its weights, simplifying the math to make it small and efficient enough to run on a tiny hardware chip. On my screen, everything worked perfectly. The model was great at spotting abnormal heartbeats in a dataset. But there was a problem. A big one. The PhD student knew how to actually build the chip, but not how to train the models. I knew how to train the models, but not the deep physics of the hardware. We were two specialists on either side of a gulf, unable to bridge the divide. Our model was designed in a way that the chip couldn't process the ECG signal in real-time. We were facing a classic lab-to-real-world conundrum."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Fortunately, I have a background in Electrical Engineering and Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and it was time for me to put it to use. With a little digging, I could make out that the problem wasn't just in the code; there was a fundamental mismatch between the AI model's design and the hardware's physical constraints."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"The problem boiled down to memory. The on-chip buffer simply wasn't big enough to hold the entire chunk of ECG data required to perform a convolution in the traditional sense. The standard approach expected to see the whole picture at once, but our hardware couldn't provide it."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This is where the unique nature of SNNs itself became the solution. They are inherently temporal; they thrive on information that unfolds over time. So, I suggested we lean into that. Instead of fighting the hardware's limitations, we could use the SNN's strengths. I proposed we implement a simple First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queue. As each new ECG sample streamed in, it would be pushed into the queue while the oldest sample was dropped. The convolution would then operate on the contents of this constantly updating queue at any given moment."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This completely changed the dynamic. It aligned our software architecture with the physical reality of the hardware. We were no longer trying to force a batch-processing model onto a streaming system; we were processing the data in its native, temporal format. It was a solution that came directly from connecting the theory of SNNs with the practical data structures used in signal processing. It was a stark reminder that ultimately, even within engineering, there is no room to neglect the broader picture of systems thinking in favor of optimizing technology at the granular level. Looking back, this was exactly the kind of problem that two powerful telescopes, each in isolation, could not solve. Both my teammate and I saw our individual stars with remarkable clarity, but the problem that we needed to solve lay in the blackness of space between them. Neither of our instruments alone could tackle it."}]]}]
